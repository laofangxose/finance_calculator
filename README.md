# Finance Calculator

Static React + TypeScript + Vite site for comparing novated lease quotes against buying outright or taking a standard car loan. Built to be extensible for future calculators (pay calculator, home loan calculator).

## Tech
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – type-check and build for production
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint

## Next steps
- Implement the novated lease calculator logic and comparisons (outright vs car loan).
- Add FAQ/disclaimers and assumptions content.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or Vercel once the calculator is ready.
